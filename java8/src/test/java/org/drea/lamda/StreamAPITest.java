		A stream is a sequence of data items that are conceptually produced one at a time.

		Java 8 adds a Streams API (note the uppercase S) in java.util.stream based on this idea;
		Stream<T> is a sequence of items of type T .
		You can think of it as a fancy iterator for now.

		The Streams API has many methods that can be chained to form a complex pipeline just like Unix commands.


		Streams are the key abstraction for processing collections of values
		and specifying what you want to have done.
		You leave to the stream library to parallelize the operatin, using multiple threads and combining the result

		You can create streams for collections, arrays, generators or iterators

		Use :
		- filter, to selects elements
		- map, to transform elements

		other operations to transforming streams are:
		- limit
		- dinstinct
		- sorted
